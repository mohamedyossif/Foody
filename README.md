It is an easy-to-use Food Ordering App using Flutter, making it simple for users to pick and buy their favorite meals. The app includes a search feature for finding meals and lets users change the number of items in the cart, making it more user-friendly.
For the Foody App, I used a variety of tools:
1. Provider for managing app state.
2. Firebase service for user logins and data storage.
3. Shared preferences for saving user settings and data.
4. Http for network requests and API integration.
5. Validator for checking user inputs.
